### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Phuoc Nguyen**. A **Full Stack Developer** having specialization in **back end & front end development**. I have 9+ years of experience in **Web Development**.
One of my core strengths lies in backend programming using .NET and working with frontend frameworks like Angular and TypeScript. I have a deep understanding of these technologies and have successfully applied them in various projects. Additionally, my proficiency extends to mobile application development, particularly with Flutter.
